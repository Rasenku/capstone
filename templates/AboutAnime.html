    <h1>Anime In A Nutshell</h1>
    <h2>Anime is a word used by people living outside of Japan to describe cartoons or animation produced within Japan. Using the word in English conversation is essentially the same as describing something as a Japanese cartoon series or an animated movie or show from Japan.</h2>
    <h2>The word itself is simply the Japanese word for cartoon or animation and in Japan is used by people to describe all cartoons regardless of country of origin. For example, a Japanese person would think of Sailor Moon and Disney's Frozen as both being anime, not as two different things from separate genres.</h2>
